_4 Why IoT Security and Privacy is of Particular Interest_

The 'Internet of Things' re-introduces the same types of security and privacy
concerns for end users. The difference, though, is there are often no clear
controls nor documentation available to inform a user about risks introduced
with the IoT device(s) deployed. Further, studies have shown[0] that relying
on the end user for security and privacy decisions is prone to failure.

_4.1 Non-technical or uninterested consumers._

End-users are incapable of evaluating the privacy and security implications
of any particular IoT device as deployed in their home ecosystem. Additionally,
more often than not[1] the deployed devices lack practical mechanisms to
perform secure updates or security policy enforcement.

_4.2 Challenging device discovery and inventory._

Households are increasingly connecting more devices[2] to the network. As more
of theese devices are IoT devices, consumers are unable to make better decsions
about their security and privacy posture. Consumers can not be relied upon to
manage the devices connected to their network, and in some cases the device(s)
may not be controlled or owned by the consumer (power/water/gas meters).

Identifying devices which are misbehaving is beyond the ability of consumers and
likely beyond the ability of the ISP to identify due to NAT and other similar
technologies emlpoyed in consumer networking.

_4.3 Effects on Internet access service._

Any device which is misbehaving, or compromised on the local consumer network
makes the whole of the network less secure, and less performant. IoT devices
deployment into the consumer network does not change this demonstrably, except
that as discussed in 4.2 and [3], there are more challenges in remediation.

These challenges increase cost to the consumer:
  o by reducing access bandwidth
  o increasing access times
  o loss of credentials/identity to malware infected hosts on the local network

Costs for ISPs are increased as well through:
  o increased customer support interactions
  o increased bandwidth usage across the ISP network

Finally, poor security practices across the network impact other Internet users
through:
  o increased harmful traffic
  o spam with more/other malware infection vectors
  o denial of service attacks
